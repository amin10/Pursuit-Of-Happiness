      <h3>Why pursue happiness?</h3>
      <p>"Happiness is the meaning and purpose of life, the whole aim and end of human existence." -Aristotle</p>
      <p>Why chase merely the fastest way to get somewhere when you can aspire for the happiest route? Some might say that life is too short
        for such indulgences, but don't you think that rather, it is the shortness of life that makes every walk and every journey all the more precious?</p>
      <p>Don't let life pass you by! Let us help you find a happier way to travel.</p>
